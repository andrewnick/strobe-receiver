Janis
=====

```elixir

{:ok, song} = File.read "/Users/garry/Seafile/Peep/audio/song.raw"

Janis.Player.play song

```

Dependencies
------------

- erlang 18.x

- elixir 1.x

- `avahi`, `dnssd`

    sudo apt-get install -y avahi-daemon libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev

- `portaudio`

     sudo apt-get install -y portaudio19-dev

- `libsamplerate`:

     sudo apt-get install -y libsamplerate0 libsamplerate0-dev

Running
------

### Linux

Use chrt to use a Round-robin scheduler by default (plus running as root enables the fifo scheduler for the audio thread)

    make && sudo chrt --rr 99  /home/garry/elixir-current/bin/iex -S /home/garry/elixir-current/bin/mix

Running the entire app as fifo seems like a good idea but seems to lead to madness -- perhaps because the receiver starves the rest of the system of processor time (?). Things stop working anyway.

Audio Setup
-----------

The sound card clicks between tracks unless you disable the auto-mute feature.

Exactly the best way to do this is a WIP but as a working solution:

- run `alsamixer`
- set "Auto Mute Time Left" and "Auto Mute Time Right" to their max values (10.66s <- ??)
- `/usr/bin/amixer -c 0 sset "Auto Mute" Disabled` - not sure this does anything
- `sudo alsactl store` save the settings

Other DACS:

- https://polyvection.com/ very low-cost DACs:
  - https://polyvection.com/support/plain-series/comparison-chart/ - PlainDAC would be adequate - that's only ~ E10
  - https://polyvection.com/shop/plaindac/
  - All support Pi2 natively + Beaglebone black (with kernel mods)

Possible alternate computers
----------------------------

TODO
----

- Improve OS X monotonic time function. e.g. using https://github.com/ChisholmKyle/PosixMachTiming/blob/master/src/timing_test.c
- Look at improved packet offset smoothing behaviour. Need something that filters out the very small scale fluctuations but doesn't lag too far behind the 'actual' value -- impossible?
  - http://www.edaboard.com/thread160059.html
- Look at Zieglerâ€“Nichols method for tuning the PID factors

Soft real-time
--------------

- install `libcap2-bin` on Ubuntu/debian/raspbian
- <http://www.drdobbs.com/soft-real-time-programming-with-linux/184402031>
- <http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html> :

```
    CAP_SYS_NICE

    * Raise process nice value (nice(2), setpriority(2)) and
      change the nice value for arbitrary processes;
    * set real-time scheduling policies for calling process, and
      set scheduling policies and priorities for arbitrary
      processes (sched_setscheduler(2), sched_setparam(2),
      shed_setattr(2));
    * set CPU affinity for arbitrary processes
      (sched_setaffinity(2));
    * set I/O scheduling class and priority for arbitrary
      processes (ioprio_set(2));
    * apply migrate_pages(2) to arbitrary processes and allow
      processes to be migrated to arbitrary nodes;
    * apply move_pages(2) to arbitrary processes;
    * use the MPOL_MF_MOVE_ALL flag with mbind(2) and
      move_pages(2).

Avahi
-----

The broadcaster lookup is done using Avahi through [dnssd_erlang][]

This requires the following software (on Ubuntu):

    apt-get install avahi-daemon libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev
